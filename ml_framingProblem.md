*February 2020*

**Scientific Method**
1. Set the research goal.
1. Make a hypothesis
1. Collect the data.
1. Test your hypothesis.
1. Analyze your results.
1. Reach a conclusion.
1. Refine the hypothesis and repeat.

**Ask Yourself**
1. What problem is my product facing?
1. Will machine learning be a good solution to this problem?

**Know the Problem First Before Playing With the Data**
* List potential solutions in order to generate the best model.
* Perform exploratory data analysis to understand you data.  Not doing so will could misdirect you to a different solution.

**ML needs a lot of data**
Neural networks require hundreds of thousands of data for a good working model.  ML models that are linear will require less, like a couple thousand datapoints.

# ML Problems
* Clustering
* Anomaly Detection
* Causation
* No Existing Data
