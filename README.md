# About
Ever since I picked up computer vision, all I ever wanted to do in my daily routine is code code and code.  I'm currently self-teaching myself Deep Learning and Machine Learning and I'm intrigued by the large potential it has in every occupation.  Inspired by Adrian Coyler and Patrick Lui, I brought myself to read papers to keep myself up to date on the development of AI.  And just like Coyler and Lui, I would love to summarize every paper I read and share my paper notes to those who are curious, but need an overview of the core concepts.  With all said, if you are a researcher, practioner, or undergrad student, I hope you can take something away from my exploration to AI.

# Getting Started
I recommend reading the most popular neural network architectures to gain an understanding of it's impact in AI.
