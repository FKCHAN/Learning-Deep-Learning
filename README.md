# About
Ever since I picked up computer vision, all I ever wanted to do in my daily routine is code code and code.  I'm currently self-teaching myself Deep Learning and Machine Learning and I'm intrigued by the large potential it has in every occupation.  Inspired by [Adrian Coyler](https://blog.acolyer.org/about/) and [Patrick Lui](https://github.com/patrick-llgc/Learning-Deep-Learning), I brought myself to read papers to keep myself up to date on the development of AI.  And just like Coyler and Lui, I will summarize every paper I read so that not only I have an understanding of the paper, but so that you can understand the topic without in depth reading.  I would love to share my paper notes to those who are curious, but need an overview of the core concepts.  With all said, if you are a researcher, practioner, or undergrad student, I hope you can take something away from my exploration to AI.

# Getting Started
I recommend reading the most popular neural network architectures to gain an understanding of it's impact in AI. <br>

## Methods
I believe that people who are just getting started with deep learning should understand the essential techniques in manipulating data for optimal performance.
