# Dedicated Deep Learning Libraries

**Tensorflow** <br>
A machine learning (ML) library developed by Google. It is GPU accelerated and allows ML implementation on single and multiple architectures, allowing fast deep neural networks on both cloud andfog services.Programming langugaes supported are:
* Python
* Java
* C
* C++
* Go <br>

Tensorflow providesa visualization tool called the *TensorBoard*. Helps users understand how their model works and how data is flowing, while also allowing users to debug their model. Supported higher-level programming itnerfaces include:
* Keras
* Luminoth
* TensorLayer <br>

[Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

**Theano** <br>
A Python library that allows user to define, optimize, and evaluate numberical computations involving multi-dimensional data. Supports both CPU and GPU modes.  Cons include slow compile time, but has a large community. <br>

**(Py)Torch** <br>
A scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning models and algorithms.  Does lack visualization tools, but easy to debug and well documentented.  Programming langauages supported:
* Lua
* Python
* C
* C++ <br>

Has no higher-level programming interface.
